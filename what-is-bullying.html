      <h1>What is Bullying?</h1>
      <p>Bullying is an ongoing, aggressive behavior that is used to intimidate or oppress a victim which involves a power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time.</p>
      <h2>Types of Bullying</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Physical Bullying</h3>
          <p>Hurting a person's body or possessions. Examples include hitting, kicking, pushing, shoving, spitting, tripping, and taking or breaking someone's things. This type of bullying is often the most visible, but it's not the only type.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>Verbal Bullying</h3>

          <h3>Social Bullying</h3>
          <p>Sometimes called relational bullying, this involves hurting someone's reputation or relationships. It includes leaving someone out on purpose, telling other children not to be friends with someone, spreading rumors, and embarrassing someone in public. This can be very subtle and insidious.</p>
